Emergency HIP Proposal Process

Author: Gateholder

vote medium: VeHNT

Summary:

This procedure outlines the steps to pass an Emergency Improvement Proposal (EIP) with specific vote thresholds for different sub DAOs.
The procedure covers the requirements for the Mobile and IoT sub DAOs and the HNT (Helium) vote quorum. The vote threshold for the Mobile and IoT sub DAOs is set at 75% of the possible votes, while for the HNT vote quorum, it is set at 25%.
Proposal Submission: Any member of the respective sub DAO or the HNT community can submit an Emergency Improvement Proposal. The proposal should clearly state the urgency and rationale for the proposal, along with the proposed changes or improvements.

motivation:

A process is needed to act in a swift manner to problems that arise that need to be dealt with in a timely fashion

Proposal Evaluation:

Upon submission, the proposal will undergo an initial evaluation by the relevant DAO administrators or community group or working group. 
They will assess the proposal's feasibility, urgency, and potential impact. If the proposal meets the criteria, it proceeds to the voting stage after 24hrs.
Voting Setup: Once the proposal is approved for voting, the voting setup process begins on Realms. 
With varying time limits depending on urgency, And can be run concurrently (meaning you could vote on a 1 day, 3 day, and 7 day time table)
Notification and Discussion: All members of the relevant Mobile and IoT sub DAOs and the HNT community will be notified about the proposed emergency improvement and the upcoming voting process. A designated communication channel, such as the discord and the wallet notification system, will be used to facilitate discussions, questions, and clarifications related to the proposal.
Voting Mechanism: To ensure transparency and security, Realms will be used. This mechanism should allow members to cast their votes securely and anonymously. 

Voting Rules:

The voting rules will be defined in alignment with the specified thresholds. 
For the Mobile and IoT sub DAOs, the proposal must receive a minimum of 75% of the possible votes in favor to be considered approved.
For the HNT vote quorum, the proposal must reach a minimum of 25% of the possible votes in favor to be considered approved.
Vote Quorum Verification: To proceed with the vote, the DAO administrators will verify if the required quorum has been achieved.
For the Mobile and IoT sub DAOs, the vote quorum is set at 50% of the possible votes. If the vote quorum is not met, the proposal will be considered unsuccessful, and the process ends.
If the vote quorum is met, the procedure continues to the next step.

additional rules,

the community and wallet holders must be notified 24 hrs before the vote is started.

drawbacks:

emergency votes can be used to negativly impact each DAO's standing with eachother, the emergency proposal could become a new vector of attack.

deployment metrics:

A system will need to be created to notify as much of the community as possible, by posting an announcment in the Officail Discord, and official forums/pages, as well as sending notifications to wallet holders.

Success metrics:

proactivly desuade hostile forces that might attempt to subvert or steal tokens or to manipulate rewards. ruduce the amount of time certain exploits that need to be resolved in a timely fashion.
